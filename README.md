# Assignment3_Alarm

## How to play
Everytime the alarm went off, the board will generate a random number as the **"correct distance"**.

And to disable the alarm, you will play with the distance with the ultrasonic sensor to "guess" the **correct distance.**

The color and number on the ring works as the indicator of whether the **distance** now is closer or further.
